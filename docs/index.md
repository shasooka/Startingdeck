# Welcome to Starting Deck

This is a place built for the sole purpose of upskilling yourself in various areas, sharing knowledge on the new tools, best practices and all the funky stuff in the world.

## Layout

Upskilling yourself is a very big and vast ocean which how much we try can never be empbutied.

Taking one bucket from this ocean at a time is the key idea here, so all the ideas are welcomed.

You can find the layout of this Repository as below.
